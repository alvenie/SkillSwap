## Motivation

Traditional learning platforms are expensive and impersonal. We identified several key challenges:

- **High Costs**: Professional tutoring services cost $50-100/hour, making learning inaccessible to many
- **Skill Gaps**: Everyone has skills they want to learn AND skills they can teach, but no easy way to connect
- **Lack of Community**: Difficulty finding local learning partners who share your interests
- **Coordination Issues**: No unified platform for scheduling, payment, and communication
- **Trust & Safety**: Concerns about meeting strangers for learning exchanges

**The Solution**: SkillSwap creates a trusted marketplace where people exchange skills, build community, and learn affordably.
